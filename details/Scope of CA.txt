-Areas: Hospital, housing, agriculture, Economy, Environment
-Cleaning dataset
- After cleaning minimuns: 10K Rows  12 Columns

- Problem description
	- Intro and objective
	- Dataset Chosen reasoning
- Motivation and Challenges
	- Present the challenges the dataset shows initially
	- Identify Cathegorical discrete and continous data
	- Questions about the data quality
	- Show pre-conceptions about the data and how we intend to explore it.
	- Questions for Acquiring knowledge of data.
	- Description and explanation of the techiniques we used for the data analisys.
- Data Statistical parameters (mean, median,minimun, maximun, deviation)
	- Question parameters and tendencies.
	- What does that means for the data?
	- Does that consists with the main conceptions?
-Apply normalizations/standardization Scalar on numerical data. 
	- How can we explore the data with these normalizations?
	- Does that changes any understanding of the data?
-Line, scatter and Heatmaps for correlation between features
	- Reasoning for the correlations
	- What can we learn from these plots?
- Data exploratory Analisys; identification of sub-groups of features and new learnings we explored.
	- What new was learned from the Analisys done so far?
	- Is something not explored? why can't we explore this?
	- Are the new findings beliveable or is the data compromised? how?
- Apply dummy encoding to categorical cathegories
	- How does this work and what's the reasoning behind it?
	- what new can be learned about the dataset?
	- pros and cons from how the applied Dummy encoding can be interpreted and how relevant is it for the data
- Apply PCA with a chosen number of components
	- The profile of the components extracted
	- The correlation between the components is real?
	- The distance between items have an explanation?
	- The profile of the analisys answers a question? which one?
- What is the purpose of Dimentionality reduction?
	- What is Dimentionality reduction? (PCA)
	- When Dimentionality reduction should be used?
	- What we learned using it?
- Data understanding
	- Was the data plenty explored? if not why?
	- What can be learned after all the data exploration done?
	- How valid this new knowledge is? does the data demands any correction or more data?
	- how can the information learned from the data be used?
